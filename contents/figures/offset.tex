        The changing of $\gamma$ with $\gamma_0=1$. 
        We use three different color to denote three different training stage $N_0, N_1$ and $N_2$. 
        In particular, $N_0$ is the pretrain stage on the source domain, thus $\sigma$ is not used. 
        In the stage of $N_1$, $\gamma$ is set to be $0$ so as to select most transferable samples. 
        In stage $N_2$, the $\gamma$ progressively grows according to $\sigma(\cdot)$.
