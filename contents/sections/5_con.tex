This paper presents a novel method namely Thresholded Domain Adversarial Network for openset domain adaptation.
Different from previous approaches which reweigh target samples to reduce negative transfer, the proposed method progressively selects transferable target samples for domain adversarial training. 
As a result, distributions of known classes across domains can be aligned and unknown class can be correctly distinguished from the known ones.
Extensive experiments validate that our method can better solve the challenge of open set domain adaptation and outperform existing models.
On the other hand, experimental results show more and more target samples are selected from both the known and unknown classes.
To further improve the performance, we will study to how to reduce the number of selected unknown class samples while increasing the selected target samples from known classes in the future.
